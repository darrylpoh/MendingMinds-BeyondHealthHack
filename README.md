## Problem statement
How would we increase the acceptability of depression treatment among adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) aged 18-34?

## Solutions
We dissected the problem into 3 root causes:
1. High costs
2. Insufficient communication
3. Ineffective current measures

From this, we came up with 3 solutions embedded in our web app to address these problems.
